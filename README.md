# RBPscan

This repository contains code used for RBPscan publication. Among other analyses, this inlcudes comparison of RBPscan editing rates to RNA Bind-n-seq enrichments. This required (1) getting accession names for fastq files and their controls, (2) downloading fqstq files, (3) calculating 7-mer frequences, (4) calculating enrichments compared to control samples.
